# Capstone Project Proposal
This exercise is designed to help you narrow the scope of your research down to a well-defined problem whose solution you can reasonably derive over the course of the next five to six weeks. 

## Project Team
* Zohaib Manzoor
* Jacob Nathanson
* Rishi Shah
* Lavina Green
  
## Research Area(s)
> _What technical topic(s) are you planning to explore through this project?_
* Interactive Maps 
* Uploading larger sized pictures
* Live Chatting

## Problem Statement
> _Your problem statement is a concise (100 words or less) explanation of the problem that your project will address and the potential impact that the solution will have. In other words, what's "new" about this thing that you're creating and why should people care. For additional guidance, see [here](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/problem-statement/)._

#### How might we better facilitate the recycling/upcycling of used goods for people in a guilt-free and convenient manner?

## Proposed Solution
> _In 100 words or less, describe what you plan on building and how it addresses your selected problem? In what ways is your solution novel?_

#### A social media platform that lets users upload images and context on items they no longer use such as clothes, shoes, etc, so that someone else can connect and pick up the item(s). Instead of throwing out unwanted items or locate a donation area, our platform makes it easier for users to browse through unwanted items, ask about them, and eventually connect to get the item(s). 

## Anticipated Technical Challenges
> _What are the key technical challenges that your team will have to solve in order to ship this solution?_
* Integrating a interactive live map responsible for displaying places to donate cloths, shoes, and other unwanted items
* Filtering based off categories of items (shoes, tools, sporting equipment, etc)

## Supporting Research
> _Please include hyperlinks to blogs, research papers, and books that have helped inform your opinion so far or those that you believe will guide your research?_
